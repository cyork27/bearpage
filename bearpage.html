	<p>Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. Don’t ever play yourself. Bless up. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. How’s business? Boomin. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel.</p>
